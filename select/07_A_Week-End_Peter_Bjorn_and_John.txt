A broken glass in a swimming pool
A fall in a dying afternoon
A breath on one last cigarette
You leave me scrolling on your telephone
Fading footsteps down the stairs
Trembling branches in the air
A whisper in a megaphone
We're only good for a weekend

Through a gap in a broken wall
Half-asleep in a new-built mall
Like Charles Darwin in a Disney World
I spot you scrolling on your telephone
You lick your gums, you itch your cheek
I'm movin' back to the exit
The sun beats down on the city street
We're only good for a weekend

Only good
Only good for a weekend
Only good, only good
We're only good for a weekend

A broken glass in a swimming pool
A fall in a dying afternoon
A breath on one last cigarette

Only good
Only good for a weekend
Only good, only good
Only good (Only good)
Only good for a weekend
Only good (Only good), only good
We're only good for a weekend

Only good
Only good for a weekend
Only good, only good
Only good, only good, only good, only good
Only good
Only good for a weekend
Only good, only good
Only good for a, only good for a
Only good, only good (Only good)
Only good for a weekend
Only good, only good
We're only good for a weekend
